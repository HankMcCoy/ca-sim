# Cellular Automata Simulator

## Description

I'm planning on flushing this out to be a simple simulator of any of the 256 elementary one-dimensional [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton) (only 88 of which are unique) that can easily be dropped onto a webpage as a simple widget.

## Todos

- [X] Add button to kick off steps on an interval (with accompanying stop button)
- [ ] Provide helpful validation messages for invalid automata (most notably odd numbered ones)
- [ ] Add option to set/reset the initial state of the tape
- [ ] Style to not look completely terrible
- [X] Reposition the viewport to match the output as it grows
- [X] Resize the cells once the output extends beyond the size of the viewport
- [ ] Switch to using canvas for rendering
