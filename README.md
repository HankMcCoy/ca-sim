# Cellular Automata Simulator

I'm planning on flushing this out to be a simple simulator of any of the 256 elementary one-dimensional [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton) (only 88 of which are unique) that can easily be dropped onto a webpack as a simple widget.
